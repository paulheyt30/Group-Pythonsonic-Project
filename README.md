Abstract: This program focuses on the subject of “the era of three-pointers” and “four factors of basketball success”, and proposes research questions based on these two subjects. The study uses regression and classification algorithms to construct a machine learning prediction model based on historical NBA game data sets and analyze factors that affect the 3-pointer and the prediction of game outcomes. The research aims to provide scientific advice and technical basis for basketball game tactics through machine learning and data analysis, and hopes to provide some ideas for applying algorithm science to sports.
